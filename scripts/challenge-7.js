/*
	Challenge 7: Create a function that filters out negative numbers

			In this challenge, you'll have a function that takes an array as an input
			and returns an array. But if all goes according to plan, it'll remove the
			negative numbers. This is another example of a task that'll be useful when
			combing through data and looking for clever ways to eliminate "bad data."
 */

// you can log out to the console or to the output container like this:
// output.innerText = "My output";
const output = document.getElementById("output-container");
if (!output) throw "Output container not found.";

//@ts-check
// your code starts after this line

var array = [18, -42, 21, 6, -50];
array = array.filter(function (x) {
	return x > -1;
});
console.log(array); // [18, 21, 6]
